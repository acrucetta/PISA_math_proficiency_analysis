# PISA Math Literacy Exploration
## by Andres Crucetta Nieto


## Dataset

> PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

> To analyze this dataset I took a look at features related with availability of textbooks, time spent studying, and the native language of the student. I compared these features with each student's level of math literacy to obtain insights into what makes a student more proficient in mathematics.

## Summary of Findings

Single-Variable Exploration
There's a considerable amount of students who took the test in a language different than their native one (approx. 10-15%)
Most students (75%) have books for reference for their studies, it is still worth considering why there are around 20-25% of students with no access to books.
Thankfully, most students (50%+) avoid distraction when studying, since this is a survey I would imagine this particular question to not be too reliable
Most students (60%+) don't study more than 2 extra hours per day
The level of mathematical literacy for PV5 ranged around 492~ (Level 3) with a standard deviation of 96. It seems that most student have a level 3 literacy
The average student spends approximately 6 hours working on their school homework
The average student spends approximately 2.5 hours working on guided school homework

Multi-Variate Exploration
It seems that those students who help others have higher levels of literacy, however, there's a rare outlier for those who "always" help other students. They don't seem to have higher levels of literacy. Also students for whom the test is not in their language have lower scores than those for whom it is.
There's a positive correlation between more hours of homework and higher levels of literacy. However, this didn't stand truth when looking at time spent in guided homework or studying with parents
Foreign students spent more hours studying for test than native students to achieve similar levels of literacy.

## Key Insights for Presentation

Based on the range of mathematical literacy we have most of the students around a Level 2 & 3 with some outliers at both ends.
Helping other students increases math literacy score, up to a point!. We have an interesting finding in that student that "Always" or "Almost Always" help other students study don't do as well as those who do it just "Often". My assumption is that those students that do it "Often" have more time for their own studies. We would need to explore other levels of literacy to understand this better.
Those students that study more than two hours have on average a higher level of literacy than other cohorts. Big finding for students looking to improve their grades. More study hours pays off.
It seems like the amount of time spent doing homework correlates with higher levels of Math Literacy. Guided Homework and Parent's study time doesn't perform as well.
Students who have a different than that of the test actually spend more time in their homework to reach similar levels of literacy than those for whom the test is their first language. Hard work pays off.
