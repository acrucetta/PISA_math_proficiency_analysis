# PISA_math_proficiency_analysis

## Dataset

> PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

> To analyze this dataset I took a look at features related with availability of textbooks, time spent studying, and the native language of the student. I compared these features with each student's level of math literacy to obtain insights into what makes a student more proficient in mathematics.

## Summary of Findings

> Single-Variable Exploration

* There's a considerable amount of students who took the test in a language different than their native one (approx. 10-15%)
* Most students (75%) have books for reference for their studies, it is still worth considering why there are around 20-25% of students with no access to books.
* Thankfully, most students (50%+) avoid distraction when studying, since this is a survey I would imagine this particular question to not be too reliable
* Most students (60%+) don't study more than 2 extra hours per day
* The level of mathematical literacy for PV5 ranged around 492~ (Level 3) with a standard deviation of 96. It seems that most student have a level 3 literacy
* The average student spends approximately 6 hours working on their school homework
* The average student spends approximately 2.5 hours working on guided school homework

> Multi-Variate Exploration
* It seems that those students who help others have higher levels of literacy, however, there's a rare outlier for those who "always" help other students. They don't seem to have higher levels of literacy. Also students for whom the test is not in their language have lower scores than those for whom it is.
* There's a positive correlation between more hours of homework and higher levels of literacy. However, this didn't stand truth when looking at time spent in guided homework or studying with parents
* Foreign students spent more hours studying for test than native students to achieve similar levels of literacy.
